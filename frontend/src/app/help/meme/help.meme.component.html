    <h3>Title</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The title should help you recall what the image is/looks like. For memes, the first part of the meme text may
        be
        suitable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Caption</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A caption is pithy/funny/sarcastic text that people can share along with the meme. A good caption can make a
        huge difference in how well received your meme is.
      </li>
      <li>You and other people can add additional captions or comment to the meme later.</li>
      <li>Optional - limit of 280 characters</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tag notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tags will automatically be prefixed with # when tweeting, so don't include #</li>
      <li>Use PascalCase for tags with two or more words (e.g. AlphaBeta - NOT: alphaBeta, alpha_beta, alpha beta)
      </li>
      <li>Use underscores (_) for subcategories. e.g. Muslims_Terrorism. Try to avoid subcategories though - use only
        when number of images grows beyond 50 for the main category.
      </li>
      <li>Prefer plural over singular: e.g. Communists rather Communist
      <li>camelCase is reserved for special memes used to troll, argue, etc. (troll, rhetoric...)</li>
      <li>Use "auspol" (without quotes) for Aussie content. Most memes aren't specific to Australia.: use #auspol for
        the
        ones that are
      </li>
      <li>Use "ALP" for Labor party</li>
      <li>Use "LNP" for Liberal party. "Liberals" refer to American liberals (Democrats).</li>
    </ul>
