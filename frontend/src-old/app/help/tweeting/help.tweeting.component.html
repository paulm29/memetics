    <h3>Tweeting notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't get yourself shadow-banned! Shadow banning is when you and your followers can see your tweets, but the
        rest of the world can't.
        Shadow banning can occur when you tweet too frequently to a hashtag (i.e. exceed rate limit) using the same text
        content (including hashtags). We can't say exactly how you can be shadowbanned, because
        Twitter doesn't want people to know so that spambots can't find workarounds. Ideally, always include some varied
        text when you tweet a meme, and give it at least a minute
        between tweets. Shadow bans may be temporary, but nothing is worse than finding out very few people are seeing
        your tweets due to rate limits.
